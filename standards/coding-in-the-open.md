# Coding in the open

## Measure

- All source code for any used policy and software not used for fraud detection MUST be published and publicly accessible.
- Any source code that is not currently in effect, such as new versions, proposals or older versions SHOULD be published.
- Contributors MUST never upload sensitive information regarding users, the organisation or third parties to the repository, for example: configurations, usernames and passwords, public keys and other real credentials used in the production system.
- The source code MAY provide the General Public insight into what source code lies beneath any interaction they are currently in with your organisation

## What this does

- Transparency
- Better quality code
- Auditability

## What this doesnâ€™t do

- Make things reusable

## How to test

The current version of your source code is published somewhere on the internet where anyone can view it.

Given the project has started
When anyone tries to view the source
Then the latest version of the source is available

- Is the current version of the source published on the internet where it can be seen from outside of your organisation and without the need for any form of authentication.

## Policy makers: what you need to do

- Develop policies in the Open
- Prioritise Open and transparent in policies

## Management: what you need to do

- Develop a culture that embraces Openness, learning and feedback
- Collaborate with external vendors and freelancers through working in the open

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

- Clearly split data and code: never upload sensitive information regarding users, the organisation or third parties to the repository, for example: configurations, usernames and passwords, public keys and other real credentials used in the production system
