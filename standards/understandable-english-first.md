# Understandable English first

## Measure

- All code and documentation MUST be in English.
- Any translation MUST be up to date with the English version and vice-versa.
- There SHOULD be no acronyms, abbreviations, puns or legal/domain specific terms in the codebase without an explanation preceding it or a link to an explanation.
- The Codebase SHOULD not use acronyms, abbreviations, puns or branding for names.
- Any code MAY have a translation.

## What this does

- Make your codebase and what it does understandable for a wider variety of stakeholders in multiple contexts.
- Aid in the discoverability of your codebase.

## What this doesnâ€™t do

## How to test

- See if translations and the English version have the same contents
- Validate that no unexplained acronyms, abbreviations, puns or legal/domain specific terms are in the documentation
- Test the documentation

## Policy makers: what you need to do

## Management: what you need to do

- Try to limit the use of acronyms, abbreviations, puns or legal/domain specific terms in internal communications in and between teams and stakeholders

## Developers and designers: what you need to do
