# Version control & development history

## Measure

* You MUST have a way to maintain version control for your code.
* All files in a codebase MUST be version controlled
* All decisions MUST be documented in commit messages
* Every commit message MUST link to discussions and issues wherever possible
* You SHOULD group relevant changes in commits
* You SHOULD prefer file formats that can easily be version controlled

## What this does

Version control means keeping track of changes to your code over time. This is essential as it enables collaboration at scale as well as creating structured documentation of the history of the Codebase.

Version control enables you to:

* revert to an earlier version of the Codebase whenever you want to
* record your changes and the reasons why you made them, to help future developers understand the process
* Compare two different versions
* work on changes in parallel as a team before merging them together

## What this doesnâ€™t do

## How to test

* The Codebase is kept in Version Control using software such as Git
* All commit messages explain:
  * Why the change was made
  * What the discussion about the change was and/or where to find it (with a URL)

## Policy makers: what you need to do

## Management: what you need to do

## Developers and designers: what you need to do
