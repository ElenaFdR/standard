# Being Open to contributions and collaboration

## Measure

* The Codebase MUST enable others to submit suggestions for changes to the codebase from anyone and link to it from the documentation
* The Codebase MUST have a public issue tracker that allows suggestions from anyone and link to it from the documentation
* The Codebase MUST mention an email adress for security issues and responsible disclosure
* The Codebase SHOULD have a publicly available roadmap
* The Codebase SHOULD advertise the committed engagement of involved organisations in the development and maintainance
* The Codebase MAY document the governance of the Codebase, contributions and it's community, for example in a `GOVERNANCE` file

## What this does

* Enabling to collaborative uptake of shared digital infrastructures
* Prevents forks of Codebases, in which a community that works on a project splits because there is no shared progress
* Enables users to decide to use one Codebase over another
* Enables users to fix problems and add features to the shared codebase leading to better, more reliable and feature rich software

## What this doesnâ€™t do

* Get others to reuse the Codebase

## How to test

## Policy makers: what you need to do

## Management: what you need to do

* Add to the documentation how your organisation is involved in the project, what resources it has available for it and for how long.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do
